          <br>
          <p>In second place comes <b>Hereditary</b> Directed by Ari Aster and stars Toni Collette, Alex Wolff and Milly Shaprio and it's release date is June 8th 2018. When the grand-mother  of the Graham family passes away, her daughter and grandchildren begin to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry, trying to outrun the sinister fate they have inherited. This psychological thriller won't be suitable for everyone, but if you're someone who likes to explore the different genres of horror, then Hereditary is for you. This movie is seen as one of the more disturbing horror movies, with psychological twists and turns, it is not suitable for children. Although this film is relatively new, it has won the Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Actress and Bandung Film Festival for Best Imported Film.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The third spot is owned by <b>The Conjuring</b> Released July 19th 2013, was directed by James Wan and stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. In the year of the 1970s, Lorraine and Ed Warren are called to the home of Carolyn and Roger Perron, who just recently moved into an old farmhouse with their 5 daughters, and soon enough begin experiencing bizarre paranormal activity which is the reasoning of the summoning of Lorraine and Ed. At first little occurences begin but as the movie progresses the happening get more gruesome and horrific escalating to some people almost getting killed. This film is based on a true story and is a big reason as to why people don't bother watching it, if you believe in supernatural occurences I suggest you stay away from this movie franchise, although this movie isn't too new but not old either it has one numerous awards including the Empire Award for Best Horror, Bandung Film Festival for Commendable Imported Film and Critic's Choice Movie Award for Best Sci-Fi/Horror Movie all in the year of 2014. As much as this movie is pretty frightening, I suggest it to everyone, even if you prefer the gore this relatively new horror film instantly became a classic for me.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Up next is <b>The Shining</b> Based off the book "The Shining" by the king of horror litterature Stephen King. The book being released January 28th 1977, and the iconic film being released May 23rd 1980 stars Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd and was directed by Stanley Kubrick. Writer Jack Torrence becomes the caretaker for the Overlook hotel in Colorado until the end of winter and brings his wife Wendy and son Danny who is plagued by psychic premonitions along with him. As they station in the hotel 3 on their own, Jack tries to escape his writing stump but can't, meanwhile Danny's visions become more and more disturbing as the clima hits, Jack discovers the hotel's dark secrets and begins to unravel into a homicidal maniac hell-bent on terrorizing his family. A true classic this movie is, with it's psychological point of views and mood swings created by the main character, this movie is a masterpiece and I am surprised it isn't higher on the list, the book has won 10 awards and 2 awards for the film (Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor and Saturn Award for Best DVD or Blu-ray collection). With the acting being done so perfectly to the amazing shots done by the camera crew, the crazy plot twist at the end leaves you on the edge of your seat when the movie is finished. This 2 hour film takes it time going through the different key points and represents the characters from book to film so perfectly.</p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>Last on this list is <b>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</b> Released October 1st 1974, stars Marilyn Burns, Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neil, and is also the origin to popular horror star legend "Leatherface". When Sally hears that her grandfather's grave may have been vandalized, she and her paraplegic brother, Franklin, set out with their friends to investigate. After a detour to their family's old farmhouse, they discover a group of crazed, murderous outcasts living next door. As the group is attacked one by one by the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface, who wears a mask of human skin, the survivors must do everything they can to escape. Although this movie isn't too long, this classic movie will make you forget about the time and wishing it won't ever end. The chase scenes are as intense as it get's and the idea of a human flesh mask makes the idea even more horrifying. If you enjoy the more ominous, bloody, disgusting and dingy then this movie was made for you. Not to mention it was based off true events in 1973.</p>

            <section class="scream"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>First place on my list is <b>Scream</b> Released on December 20th 1996 and was directed by Wes Craven and stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Drew Barrymore. This movie franchise holds such a special place in my heart, from watching it for the first time when I was 10 years old and completely falling in love with it. This suspensful gory thriller film starts off with a startling chase scene, Casey Becker in her house alone gets a strange phone call with a creepy voice on the other line and soon enough they're asking her horror trivia questions in order to find out her fate, but sadly doesn't she answer correctly and soon enough they appear in her house chasing her around with a knife in a black robe and a scary ghost looking mask on their face, killing her instantly. Our main character, Sidney Prescott, who's mother was brutally murdered just a year ago, get's harrased by a news reporter Gale Weathers who constantly starts asking her questions after Sidney herself was attacked by the same ghost-looking figure just a day after Casey was killed. Many people in the small town of Woodsboro, where they live seem to think the murder of her mother have to do with the attacks going on in recent times. During the film, Sidney and her friends try their best to survive and find out who this masked killer is. Near the end of the movie, we find out who the murderer is and reveals secrets we've been wondering since the beggining Sidney makes it out but sadly not everyone around her does. For me, everything about this film is absolute perfection, the performances done by each actor involved shows just how talented they all are, the representation of emotions for each person is perfection. Along with the cinematography and amazing shots taken just show how beautiful horror movies can be even with the blood. The originality the killer had with each murder had been presented so well and it's creativity shined bright. If haven't noticed, this franchise created the term and character of "Ghostface". With it's brutality, the comedy included balances this movie to be perfect for all ages. Each moment of the film never bores you and keeps you on your toes at all times, always guessing who the killer is with every new hint and information recieved just shows how interesting and complex this movie can get, unlike other horror movie franchises, Scream is one of the only ones with realistic tendencies, it isn't supernatural but yet can happen in real life, which makes it even more frightening. This franchise opened up a new type of horror called "Who done it" films which if you haven't guessed it, are films where you try and guess who the killer is before they're revealed, it inspired movies like "I know what you did last summer", "Freaky", "You might be the killer" and so much more. In the 90s, horror had been dying and not like how it was in the 70s and 80s, but with proven statistics, Scream changed the game forever and revived horror for the better good. It has won many awards including the MTV movie & TV award for Best Movie. This film has changed the game forever and is still thriving with the many sequels being released even almost 30 years later.</p>

          <p>My second place belongs to a movie you must be familiar with since it's on this page twice, <b>The Shining</b> A movie that needs no new introduction but is worth to hear about. This psychological thriller comes with amazing little twists and turns and has you on the edge of your seat at all times. Not to mention the amazing performances each actor/actress puts out is outstanding and is truly a work of art. The plot twist at the end will have you staying up at night and contemplating rewatching the film, and to put it bluntly, watching it a second time won't be any worse than the first and if anything, even better!</p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>In my third place spot is <b>The Descent</b> Released July 8th 2005, was directed by Neil Marshall and stars Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza. After Sarah's husband and daughter sadly die in a fatal car accident, her friend Juno invits her and a few other people a year later to go do what they love best, cave exploring. After being in there for quite some time, they accidently get trapped by bolders tumbling down and blocking their path to escape. After a couple panics, the girls realise they can't call anybody for help since the cave they were in had never been explored by any humans before they went it, Juno claims she picked the area so she could name it after Sarah in pity of her families death. But the climax of the film doesn't hit until some new characters join in. An unkown species they call "The Creatures" have been living down there and aren't friendly to any visitors. As the girls try and find an escape route, these monsters are on the lookout for them for trespassing into their property. The first glance at this movie may sound a little boring, but as the climax starts to build it kickstarts your adrenaline. Thinking about which girl is going to survive the numerous attacks done by these monsters makes you want to cover your face with a blanket! A perfect gory horror that will make you jump out of your seat with every perfect jumpscare. It's won the award for British Independent Film Award for Best Director and British Independent Film Award for Best Technical Achievement.</p>

          <p>Next up is "Us" Released March 22nd 2019 and was directed by Jordan Peele and stars Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke. Accompanied by her husband, son and daughter, Adelaide Wilson returns to the beachfront home where she grew up as a child.

Her worst fears soon become a reality when four masked strangers descend upon the house, forcing the Wilsons into a fight for survival. When the masks come off, the family is horrified to learn that each attacker takes the appearance of one of them. As the movie progresses, more secrets get revealed and more jaws drop. This movie way be a newer horror movie but after first watching it, I instantly went to watch all of Jordan Peele's other films, but I found none really lived up to the beauty of Us. With the insane amount of twists and turns this movie brings, the acting for the deranged characters is on point and done so flawlessly it almost feels real. The idea this film carries is just fabulous and the beautiful nnew idea this movie had created was amazing. It won 4 Black Reel Awards, 4 Critics' Choice Movie Awards, 5 Golden Trailer Awards 3 MTV Movie & TV Awards 2 NAACP Image Awards and 4 People's Choice Awards. If you love creepy startling horror films then this one is definetly for you. </p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>At the end of my list comes a very special film <b>The Others</b> Directed by Alejandro Amenabar and stars Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan. Grace, the devoutly religious mother of Anne and Nicholas, moves her family to the English coast during World War II. She awaits word on her missing husband while protecting her children from a rare photosensitivity disease that causes the sun to harm them. Anne claims she sees ghosts, Grace initially thinks the new servants are playing tricks but chilling events and visions make her believe something supernatural has occurred. Soon enough, we find out the truth of these nysterious occurences. Because this movie is last does not mean it is worse than any of the other film on this list, they are just preferences, but The Others is an amazingly crafted film with the perfect balance of psychology, terror and mystery. The dark twists and turns this movie isn't always what youe expect, but it is crafted beautifully and the acting is on point, without the great theater skills portraye by Nicole Kidman, this movie wouldn't have been as great. It has won numerous awards including Goya Award for Best film, Saturn Award for Best Actress, Goya Award for Best Director and so much more. </p>
