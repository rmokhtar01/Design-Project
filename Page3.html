          <p>The first movie on my list is <b>Spanish Judges</b> Directed by Oz Scott, released October 16th 2000 and stars Matthew Lillard, Vicent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino. A pair of priceless antique pistols is the prize sought by a sometime con man and his lowlife comrades. But this film shows that you shouldn't trust everyone you meet. As underground as this movie is, it holds such a sacred place in my heart. With the interesting point of views registered in this movie, it took me some time to fully understand and appreciate this film, after a few rewatches, I fully understood and came around to this masterpiece of a film. Every fight scene had me gasping to see who would survive, and who would survive the ones after that. With an amazing plot twist, no characters aren't likeable and everyone will get at least one laugh out of you. It's idea of revenge, greediness and obsession to get what we want is so pure and true, some character just won't take no for an answer. Although most reviews for this movie aren't always positive, it didn't stop me from reviewing it and going agaisnt the comments critics had been posting. This movie isn't for everyone, but this webpage wouldn't have been me if I didn't put my actual opinions on it. </p>

          <p>My second place belongs to <b>Charlie's Angels</b> Released on October 22nd 2000, was directed by McG and stars Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. A trio of elite private investigators armed with the latest in high-tech tools, high-performance vehicles, martial arts techniques and an array of disguises unleash their state-of-the-art skills on land, sea and air to track down a kidnapped billionaire-to-be and keep his top-secret voice-identification software out of lethal hands. Growing up, this was one of first movies I had ever seen, and I instanty fell in love with it and the actors invloved. It holds an important place in my childhood, and growing up I still watch all 3 main actresses movies till this day. With amazing and eye catching fight scenes, the trio included make an unstoppable team and Charlie's Angels is a movie for literally anyone, the perfect balance of comedy and action will answer your question "What movie am I gonna watch?"

          <br>
          <p>In third place is <b>Mr and Mrs. Smith</b> Directed by Doug Liman, released June 7th 2005 and stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. John and Jane Smith, a couple in a stagnating marriage, live a deceptively dull existence. However, each has been hiding a secret from the other: they are assassins working for adversarial agencies. When they are both assigned to kill the same target, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody), the truth comes to the surface. Finally free from their cover stories, they discover that they have been assigned to kill each other, sparking a series of explosive attacks. As incredible as this movie sounds, it is just as amazing to watch, the little twists we find out add fun and comedy, the perfect balance for a great action movie. With great performances shown by each actor, the amusement and adrenaline in your body while watching this movie because you are so curious to see what is gonna happen next is impeccable. Everytime I bring this movie up in a conversation, people always call it the movie that Angelina Jolie stole Brad Pitt from Jennifer Aniston, but I believe the movie truly deserves all the fuss it gets and some things shouldn't overshadow the brilliance of this film, it's won awards like the MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Fight, Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Rumble, Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie: Liar and more.</p>

          <p>Second to last place is <b>Kill Bill</b> Which we've already discussed, but you can never get enough of it! The intense fight scenes makes your heart stop beating and is just breath taking. Along with the great outfits worn by our lead character, really gives her a distinct look throughout the movie. The great stunts done by everyone is just crazy and done so well, not to mention the ending had me very shocked, and if you haven't seen it yet, it is one of my major suggestions for action lovers. </p>

          <br>
          <p>Last on my list is <b>John Wick</b> All 4 movies were directed by Chad Stahelski, the first one was released October 24th 2014 and the last was March 24th 2023 and stars Keanu Reeves. Legendary assassin John Wick retired from his violent career after marrying the love of his life. Her sudden death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov and his thugs steal John's prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's father, John's former colleague, puts a huge bounty on John's head. In my opinion, this franchise had been curated perfectly for Keanu Reeves, his amazing action acting skills make the role of John Wick. It's phenomenal fight scenes make this movie what it is, also with the deep backstory involved make you root for the main character. All the visuals with the eccentric colors make the movie have such a spectacular ambiance, if you love the fighting but also deep motivations, I 100% suggest this film to you!</p>
