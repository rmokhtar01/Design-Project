         <p>The next wonderful movie is probably one we've all expected, it's <b>Titanic</b> Released December 19th 1997, and directed by the famous James Cameron and starring Leonaro DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The movie has won 14 awards and 11 of them being Oscars. Although this movie is based on a true story, sitting through this 3 hour and 30 minute film will not bore you, the tale of Jack and Rose is far from tiring and keeps you on your heels at all times. It follows Jack and Rose who meet on the Titanic, a ship said to be impossible to sink. The reckless couple had fallen in love but not 100% accepted by the young Roses family who had wanted her fate to be with someone else, and not a poor boy. More drama kicks in but it doesn't stop there, the "non-sinkable" boat hits an iceberg and takes 2 hours and 40 minutes to sink to its doom. Although the story of Jack and Rose wasn't the part based on the true story, they are one of the only couples thought about when thinking of true love. The undying passion they have for each other will never be overshadowed and deserves a rightful place in this ranking.</p>

         <p>As the ranking goes on, the movies just get better, <b>The Notebook</b> Loved by so many generations is next on the list. The film was released June 25th 2004 and was directed by Nick Cassavetes and stars Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, the story is set in the 1940s around World War 2 and starts off with our main characters Allie and Noah who desperately fall in love with each other, Allie's parents don't approve of their relationship and Noah soon leaves to fight in the second world war, and at the time, seemed like their story had ended Allie falls in love with another young man. But as time passes Noah returns and it seems their love for each other was never forgotten. This classic tale has won multiple awards including the MTV movie & TV award for best kiss, Teen choice award for Choice Movie: Drama, Teen Choice award for Choice date movie and so much more. The passion between our protagonists shows true love in its purest form.</p>

         <p>In 4th place on this list is the iconic <b>Forrest Gump</b> Released July 6th 1994 and was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Sally Field. This one-of-a-kind film is considered a classic in the film industry and is about a young man named Forrest Gump who experiences his life in the 20th century in the United-States and is in the army. Throughout this movie we notice Forest's love for his lifelong friend, Jenny. His feelings for her seem to be inevitable. Although many people don't consider the main focus of this movie romance, I believe it has a rightful place on this list, and it seems the majority of viewers seem to consider this film a romantic comedy. The movie has won multiple awards including an Academy award for Best Picture, People's choice award for favorite movie, Academy award for Best Directing. Overall, Forrest Gump has earned its place on this list.</p>

         <p>The last movie on this list is <b>La La Land</b> A musical/romance directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, as he makes his second appearance on this list. The movie was released December 16th 2016. This movie follows Sebastian and Mia who are drawn together by their common desire to do what they love. But as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart. As much as people don't like musicals, which draws them away from this film, the people who have watched it seem to have worked hard for it to be this high on the list. It has many awards including the Academy Award for Best Leading Actress in Leading Role (Emma Stone), Academy Award for Best Actor in Leading Role (Ryan Gosling), Academy Award for Best Cinematography and so many more. Although this movie has a lot of musical and theatrical elements involved, it didn't stop it from getting on this list.</p>

         <p>In my first place I have <b>The Notebook</b> Which needs a new introduction. I think the movie speaks for itself when it comes to its romantic points. To me, this movie has everything it needs to be called the it romance film. To the acting and chemistry the characters have with each other, this sequence fits perfectly with the topic of love.</p>

         <br>
         <p>My second place belongs to <b>Romeo & Juliet</b> Many people get confused when looking at this film/story being second place, but the story of Romeo and Juliet may be the most famous love story of all time, it's been around since 1597 and is one of the most recognizable pieces in literature. As I only finished reading a few months ago, I felt the text and even the interpretations of the movies shows such a deep connection between our main characters. Them not being able to live without one another in a literal form may be unrealistic, but texts and films aren't always supposed to be realistic, sometimes it's good for entertainment, and that is exactly how Romeo & Juliet is. From every scene to every act the play and story has no boring points and kept me on my toes even though I had already known the ending because of the story being so famous. I also feel the comedic parts of it hang perfectly with the plot, it has a heavy finish but the comedy can really balance tragedy with laughter. Overall, the story of Romeo & Juliet can't get much more tragic than it already is, the love they had for each other was so strong they both took them to their graves.</p>

         <p>My third place is a movie already spoken about before, <b>Titanic</b> I spoke about this movie in a critics way, but my love for this movie is strong, just like anybody else. Not only is it based on a true story but the connections Jack and Rose share is unstoppable. The tragedy of this story hits hard and deep, and I believe it is the second most popular love story behind Romeo & Juliet. This film carries the right aspects to be loved by the public and it deserves all the love it gets.</p>

         <p>Compared to the other movies on this page <b>She's all that</b> Is probably the most different. Released on January 29th 1999, the movie has more romantic/comedy pieces than tragedy, it is nonetheless a wonderful romance film starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook. The story follows Laney Boggs, a shy artist and Zack Siler a popular jock, when Zack gets broken up with by his girlfriend, Taylor, the queen of their highschool, he is determined to win her back, doing so his friend makes a bet with him to start dating any girl of his friends choice in order to make Taylor jealous, the girl he choose ends up being Laney. After Zack and Laney start hanging out she finds out their relationship was based off of a bet, but what she didn't know is that Zack had fallen in love with her during the process and that their chemistry had been pure. One of the reasons why this movie is one of my favorite romantic movies is because I had grown up with it, the actors being familiar with other early 2000s movies I had also grown up with. Other than that, the romantic points in this movie always keep me entertained and the drama/comedy involved makes me enjoy the movie even more. I love how the protagonists are so different yet their relationship was so pure and even with the rocky moments, they ended up together in the end. The film has such an early 2000s feel to it and it definitely feels like nostalgia has brought this movie onto the list.</p>

        <p>Lastly, my personal piece is a film with much controversy surrounding it, <b>Twilight</b> Has a lot of people saying it sucks, but as someone who has read all 4 books, my point of view is very different. It stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. After Bella Swan decides to move in with her father in the small town of Forks, she comes upon a strange family with weird habits and ends up falling in love with the youngest son, Edward. After doing some research, and Edward confessing to her, we find out that he and his family are vampires. Many people make fun of the acting and ambiance of this film but I tend to focus more on storyline and plot rather than the other aspects, especially since I have read the original book copy. Along with the 3 other books and movies included, we see the love Bella has for Edward is inevitable, to the point where she wants to become a vampire to be with him for the rest of eternity, and he states in the films that he cannot live without her, and if she ever died he would do anything he can to kill himself as well, knowing he literally can't live without her. The couple goes through problems with other people but still manage to fight for their love and make it out in the end.</p>
