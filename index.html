        <p>On this page, is four different movies placed (not in any kind of order). These films are considered, from the public, the greatest movies of all time, with the highest ratings, and strongest appreciations. Please take note that I did not put these photos in upon my personal opinion, this is just ratings from the public.</p>

        <p><b>Introduction:</b> For decades upon our lifetime, movies have been a source of entertainment for the human race to enjoy. But over the years, the appreciation has gotten stronger. Films get praised for their photography, filmography, cinematography, acting skills, plot and so much more.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Reasoning:</b> The main reasons as to why I chose these four movies in particular is because I feel when thinking of a truly phenomenal movie, only a few come to mind, and I think these four are usually included in our heads. These movies specifically are not my personal favorites, and I believe there is a major difference between personal favorite movies and what we think the best movie is. For instance, my favorite movie would be a very personal saying, something that is my own opinion. While the best movie is something that we all, collectively agree is the best out of the other options.</p>
