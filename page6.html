          <h2><b>Why I decided to make this website</b></h2>
          <br>
          <p>Almost every night before I get into bed and decide to fall asleep, I watch a movie. No matter the genre, I feel the need to end off my day with a nice reward of sitting down for an hour and half to relax and just evaluate the next film I am going to watch. Sometimes I rewatch certain movies if I am in the mood for them, but most of the time I watch movies that I haven't seen, like ones that I've heard about but never watched, some I have been wanting to see but haven't gotten the opportunity and others just because they sound interesting. No matter how bad a production for a film could be, I could never actually get bored of watching one. It can be based off a true and very boring story but for me there will always be something interesting about it. At times, if there is an actor or actress out there that I am very fond of, I will try my best to see all the movies they have been in, no matter the importance of their role, just to be able to say "I've actually seen their whole discography". Overall, movies entertain me like almost nothing else in this world, and I see watching them as a way to escape reality and climb into the universe of whatever film I am watching next.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I decided to make this webpage to share some of my opinions with the public and see what people think. As you read this page, I give solid reasons as to why a movie has been put on a certain ranking, if someone disagrees with my ranking, I will not be upset but rather interested in what they have to say about my decision, and see what they would have changed, if some sequels of a movie I put deserve to be there instead of the one I actually decided on or if someone just thinks my opinion and final decision was stupid, either way I love hearing about the difference of opinion people have and I am always curious to hear what people have to say, especially about something I created. Another main reason as to why I chose this topic for my webpage is for people's questions like "What movie should I watch tonight?" can get answered. If you're feeling uninspired or unmotivated to search for a film to watch, my website would be a perfect place for you to search for a movie to watch, it gives you some of the best recommendations and why I decided to add them. It includes critics rankings and my rankings so two very different points of views if you are looking for something more controversial. If you didn't find my website helpful at all, that is no problem, feel free to answer my survey and scroll through Netflix for three hours trying to find a movie to watch.</p>

          <h2><b>About the author:</b></h2>
          <br>
          <p>My name is Riya Mokhtar and I am a grade 9 student at St-Thomas high school located in Montreal, Quebec. This website means a lot to me as showing my admiration for movies and so I can share my opinion and thoughts to others. I have been watching movies almost every night for a few years now and I thought it would be interesting to share my thoughts on what the best movies are for each genre. I know many people will be upset about certain decisions I have made, but one of my goals was to strike up controversy in order to engage a true conversation, like what I could have replaced certain films with and so on. Other than that, I hope this website brought light to someone's day as they were viewing, thank you for taking a look at my webpage!</p>
