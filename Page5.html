          <p><b>1. Catch me if you can</b> It is the only movie I could truly call my favorite. The storyline just touches your heart on another level and the impact this movie had on me was incredible. The fact that is based on a true story just makes it even sadder. But with some of the best acting ive ever seen, the best plot for a movie, the details included just make this movie a true masterpiece and there is no other movie on this webstie I could call my favorite other than Catch me if you can.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>2. Scream</b> My second favorite movie, but has replaced my first place at times, these two first films are always so close on my list it is very difficult to chose which one I prefer, and every few months I switch them, but for now my ranking is set. I have expressed my love for Scream in a big paragraph on my horror page, and all those words written are from the heart, no horror movie does it for me like Scream, it is my favorite franchise of all time and I know no other franchise can take it's place, with a name it gave itself in the horror community, it is just a wonderful film.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>3. Mean girls</b> Third on my list, but is one of the first movies I have ever seen, and one of the only ones I fully appreciate. It's my favorite drama piece and is just so fun with it's plot, to the directing, costume designs, acting and even cinematography this movie is absolutely perfect, when someone asks for a good teen drama movie the words "Mean girls" come falling out of my mouth quicker than you can say hi. No matter the gender and preference Mean girls may seem targeted to a specific group of people but is really for all.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>4. SLC punk</b> I had watched this movie for one of my favorite actors, Matthew Lillard, but ended up loving it for everything this film had to offer, in the beggining it is all fun and games but reality hits hard when you finish it. It had tears running down my eyes for a whole 10 minutes, and it had me like that everytime I watched it, not just the first. Want to watch a fun movie but actually has depth to it? Try SLC punk.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>5. Jennifer's body</b> As unusual as this movie seems, it is just as weird when you actually watch it, but in a good way. The plot had me confused at first and it took me a few rewatches to actually appreciate it to the fullest. Most critics have negative things to say about this film, but I see past them and love the watch every time I put it on, it can get gruesome at some points but the line delivery makes me giggle, the plot makes me sad and entertained at the same time but I love everything this romantic, drama, thriller has to offer.</p>
          <br>
          <h3><b>Honorable mentions:</b></h3>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p><b>13 going on 30</b> Is just the perfect rom-com movie to watch when feeling sad. It's fun and witty and shows us what would happen if a 13 year old suddenly became a 30 year old. With great theatrical moments and cute dancy moments this movie is just so cute and cozy. It can have you stressed, upset, frustrated but also sympathetic, happy and just rooting for our two lovers to end up together.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>50 first dates</b> Just showed us how amazing the Barrymore and Sandler duo is, out of all their movies together this movie might just be my favorite. It's cute with it's storyline and the ending is so heartwarming. No matter how many times I watch this movie I can just never get tired of it, just like the amount of times in the movie when Lucy fell in love with Henry. It was one of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore's first movies together and remain the best.</p>

          <h5><b>Horror</b></h5>
          <main>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p><b>The Craft</b> Was just the perfect movie filled with thriller and mystery components. This movie had always made me scared for our main character as she starts hanging out with the wrong group of people. As the movie goes on it just gets more and more chaotic, with its psychological twists this movie will always and forever entertain me, and I know it would have been a great movie to be on my horror list, but I did feel there was better out. Nonetheless, this film is still so amazing and the acting is just perfect.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Parasite</b> Had me shocked with it's brutal ending. It may not be originally in english, but it doesn't take anything away from this masterpiece of a movie. One major thing I love about it, is that everything that happened was truly unexpected, everything had come with a gasp and I love how you could never guess any of the things that would happen in this movie, it's title, it's poster even the first thrity minutes won't have you prepared for the ending.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Action</b></h5>
          <main>

            <section class="alien"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p><b>The 300</b> Was a movie I first saw when I was actually learning about Sparta and Athens so it helped me understand more of what the movie had to offer. I think this movie has some of the best fight/battle scenes a movie has to offer, not only do those scenes fit so well, the plot and storyline just worked so well, it would have been on the actual action movie ranking if the other five weren't just a little better. But I overall really enjoyed this film, and it helps if you've learned and remember the history of this film.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Alien</b> Is a movie considered to be a classic, some of the other Alien movies stand well next to the first one, but I honestly prefer this one more, with some of the best cgi it had to offer at the time. The acting is some of the best and the movie birthed one of the best final girls we've ever recieved. The concept had been ahead of it's time and with this great film, comes some greater sequels.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Comedy</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="zoolander"></section>
            <section class="austin-powers"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p><b>Zoolander</b> Had always made me laugh, with it's idiotic but hilariously written characters I always laugh when watching it. Ben Stiller can play the most generic person in the world to the weirdest person you would ever seen, and I believe movies like this just prove my point. As unique as this movie is, it just keeps you laughing throughout all of it and I 100% consider it a classic, it has a sequel released 8 years ago but I definetly don't think it lived up to the first one, but still a solid sequel compared to others.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Austin Powers</b> Was the first Mike Myers movie i've ever seen, even before Shrek. And till this day, the three movies will always make me laugh out loud with no hesitation. Austin Powers will always be my number one spy, it has some of the best comedy I have ever watched, sometimes a movie that has a stupid plot can just make the perfect comedy movie, and I feel that is what this film is, but in the best way possible. If you want something to make you laugh and nothing else, I suggest this movie to you.</p>
          <br>

          <h5><b>Dystopian</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="the-hunger-games"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>In my opinion, <b>The Hunger Games</b> Is one of the best dystopian movies the film industry has to offer. The whole franchise has some of the best traits for a dystopian universe, from the characters, their looks, names, concepts and more. The performances, cinematography, directing, production and more was crafted so perfectly. Many other films could have been here instead of this franchise but the reason why I picked it is because it made such a big name of itself, everybody knows it and loves it. I have never met anyone who has anything negative to say about it, and that's the way it should be.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Punk</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="slc-punks"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>When I say <b>SLC Punk</b> Is the best punk genre movie I have seen, I truly mean that. From the eccentric colors and shots, to some of the most beautiful acting I have seen, this movie is just so perfect. It deserves to be known more throughout Hollywood but sadly the audience failed it. Matthew Lillard delivers some of the most amazing acting I have ever seen in one of the saddest scenes I have ever watched. The developpement this film shows throughout our main character is so heartbreaking but is reality. One of the things about this film is that it will give a sign to so many of the viewers watching it, at some point in our lives, we have to face reality and can't always do what we want.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Thriller</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="what-happened-to-monday"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>I saw <b>What happened to monday</b> A very long time ago but still remember most of it. A friend had reccomended it to me and I still remember the first time I watched it, I had been very invested as I should have been. It's a dystopian/adventure with tones of thrill, the mid-point to end really keeps you on your toes, the idea of it all is so original and there is literally no film like it. As underrated as this film is, I suggest it to everyone, it isn't targeted towards a certain group of people, no age restrictions or anything of the sort, but enjoyable for all. </p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Adventure</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="the-lord-of-the-rings"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>The movie <b>Lord of the Rings</b> Is what one calls a cinematic masterpiece. Me and my family are some of the biggest Lord of the Rings fans as we have the extended version of the movies on DVD that come with deleted scenes, behind the scenes and extra clips. As famous as this movie is, it truly deserves all the love and support it gets. The spin-off, The Hobbit was great, but it didn't compare to our original trilogy. Lord of the Rings has the perfect balance of adventure, action, romance, fantasy points and even some comedic relief. The storyline is wonderfully adapted from the books and I believe that it is the best trilogy of all time.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Sci-Fi</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="snowpiercer"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>The film <b>Snowpiercer</b> Is a phenomenal film and deserves so much more attention than it gets. As many famous as mamy other science fiction movies there are, I feel Snowpiercer deserves way more love and attention, this dystopian that's set in the future just makes you scream at the screen, it has some disturbing sequences but in the end it all leads down to the main plot, which is crafted so delicately but so perfectly. Chris Evans played a character he hasn't before and it was such a relief to see play someone who isn't like his other characters, it just showed how versatile he can be as an actor. The ending will have you jumping but also makes you want to rewatch it right away.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Sports</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="shes-the-man"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p>For sports, I believe <b>She's the man</b> Was the right pick for this category. Although this film is a also a comedy and romance, the topic of soccer is the biggest part of the plot. Our main character is so focused on getting on the soccer team and proving herself to everyone that she is as good as the boys soccer team that she pretends to be one of them. The dedication she had just proves this movie is more than just for laughs is incredible. It has always keeped me entertained throughout the whole film and I suggest it even as a rom-com.</p>
          <br>
          <h5><b>Mystery</b></h5>
          <main>
            <section class="knives-out"></section>
          </main>
          <br>
          <p><b>Knives Out</b> Is the perfect mystery to watch as family, alone, with friends, no matter who you're with, it will always be entertaining. As the suspense kicks in, the adventure begins and we are always guessing who the culprit could be, the ending is so complex and a little confusing at first, but after more rewatches you start to understand and realise how clever the film actually is, nobody could have guessed the ending, even if you guessed who our villain is, the ending will forever be a surprise.</p>
