          <p>First on this page is <b>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</b> An iconic film directed by John Hughes, released December 19th 1986 and stars Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck and Mia Sara. Ferris Bueller has a skill at cutting classes and getting away with it. Intending to make one last duck-out before graduation, Ferris calls in sick, "borrows" a Ferrari, and embarks on a one-day journey through the streets. On Ferris' trail is high school principal Rooney, determined to catch him in the act. As funny as this movie is, it is as incredible. The great adventure that Ferris has in his very very long day will keep you entertained throughout the entire film. It is considered a classic it today's day in age and deserves being in first place. The laughs it gets out of you are just inevitable, this movie standing alone with no sequels is honestly just perfect and the film doesn't need another to support it. It's won awards like a National Film preservation Award, a Hall of Fame Motion Pictures Award, Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture and more.</p>

          <p>Next up is <b>Airplane</b> Directed by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, was released on July 2nd 1980 and stars Leslie Nielsen, Julie Hagerty and Jonathan Banks. When the passengers and crew of a jet are incapacitated due to food poisoning, a rogue pilot with a drinking problem must cooperate with his ex-girlfriend turned stewardess to bring the plane to a safe landing. I had first watched this film over 5 years ago, and although I don't remember all of it, what I do remember is that it was absolutely hilarious. This movie all on itself is just pure comedy, it is impossible not to sit through it and not let out at least a little giggle, even a big laughing session. Every single video or comment I see about this film is all positive and calling it amazing and just overall hilarious, it's won awards like a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Comedy, BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay and Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. A perfect adult comedy is what it is and deserves it's place on this list.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Third place comes <b>The Hangover</b> Released on June 5th 2009, directed by Todd Phillips and stars Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms. Phil, Stu and Alan travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate the impending marriage of their friend, Doug. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan have no memory of the previous night's events and must find Doug before the wedding can take place. As interesting and funny as this film sounds, it is impossible to not die of laughter, the crazy events that happen in the city of Las Vegas are inevitable for our three main characters. After the success of the first movie, it made itself a trilogy, but nothing is actually comparable to first film. The name speaks for itself with it's title and leaves you with a great laugh at the end, piecing everything together as the movie comes on is another amazing trait, and with the information we get every few minutes is like laughing gas. With awards like the AFI Award for Movie of the Year, a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, MTV Movie for Best Gut-Wrenching production and so much more. To feel the absolute thrill, this movie would be perfect.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Up next is <b>Superbad</b> Directed by Greg Mottola, released on August 17th 2007 and stars Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Two inseparable best friends navigate the last weeks of high school and are invited to a gigantic house party. Together with their nerdy friend, they spend a long day trying to score enough alcohol to supply the party and inebriate two girls in order to kick-start their sex lives before they go off to college. Their quest is complicated after one of them falls in with two inept cops who are determined to show him a good time. Going into watching this movie for the first time, you will not know what to expect, the title doesn't give much of the plot away and I love that. With the iconic "McLovin" scene, this movie has so many more scenes to offer with great comedy and amazing disatrous events that will keep you on your toes. Although the ending of the film was a little sad, I think this movie has so many laughs to offer that you just can't get enough of, it's won awards such as Canadian Comedy Award for Multimedia, Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Film, Young Hollywood Award for Best Breakthrough and more. Evertime I watch this film, I just can't get enough of it.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Last on the critics list is <b>Coming to America</b> Released June 26th 1988, directed John Landis and stars Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. Prince Akeem is the prince of a wealthy African country and wants for nothing, except a wife who will love him in spite of his title. To escape an arranged marriage, Akeem flees to America accompanied by his persnickety sidekick, Semmi, to find his queen. Disguised as a foreign student working in fast food, he romances Lisa, but struggles with revealing his true identity to her and his marital intentions to his king father. As bizarre as this film sounds it is actually quite hilarious. With a sequel that just came 3 years ago, it didn't live up to the first one released over 3 decades ago. Eddie Murphy embodies the main character and does an oustanding performance to make this movie funny. Although I do prefer his other work, such as Norbit and would have replaced it instead of this film, I still get good laughs out of it. With a satisfying ending, this movie is very solid. It's won awards like the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, NAACP Award for Outstanding Motion Picure, People's Choice Award for Favorite Comdedic Movie Actor and more.</p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>First on my list is <b>White Chicks</b> Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, was released June 23rd 2004 and stars Marlon Wayans Shawn Wayans. Two FBI agent brothers, Marcus and Kevin Copeland, accidentally foil a drug bust. As punishment, they are forced to escort a pair of socialites to the Hamptons, where they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper. But when the girls realize the FBI's plan, they refuse to go. Left without options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose as the sisters, transforming themselves from African-American men into a pair of blonde, white women. The first time I watched this film is because a friend had reccomended it to me, the rest of the times that I watch it is because I needed a good laugh. Nothing can make me explain how absolutely hilarious this movie is, and it never get's old. The jokes brought out will have you on the floor and with such a funny movie comes with great acting too, a movie doesn't have to be a period piece to have good acting but the duo given out just embodied our two main characters. Many people say that this movie wouldn't have passed if it was released in today's day in age, but either way it is impossible to not laugh at this hilariously pieced film. Not only is it funny, but the storyline keeps you on your toes and are always anxious to see what the ending will turn out to be. With an amazing dance sequence, the comedy is absolute gold and no other comedy movie could be in first place like this one is.</p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>Next on my list is <b>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</b> Released May 25th 1975, was directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam and stars Graham Chapman, John Cleese and Eric Idle.  When the mythical king of the Britons leads his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail, they face a wide array of horrors, including a persistent Black Knight, a three-headed giant, a cadre of shrubbery-challenged knights, the perilous Castle Anthrax, a killer rabbit, a house of virgins, and a handful of rude Frenchmen. From the opening sequence this movie will have you dying of laughter, I could barely hold my breath with every silly thing that showed up on screen. After watching this film, I quicly went to watch the next Monty Python I could find, which was Life of Brian, and although it was hilarious, it wasn't as good as The Holy Grail. The storyline by itself is a comedy joke added in and it fits the film so well. Every second of this film is just pure comedy, and all types of it too, it can be litteral, ironic, sarcastic and either will never fail to make me laugh. If anybody needs to watch an amazing comedy movie, this film is the one I would bring up, it is a must watch for everyone. The different characters with all kind of stories all together just fit so perfectly. As funny and amazing as this movie is, it was named the second-best comedy movie of all time.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Third on my list is <b>Freaky Friday</b> Directed by Mark Waters, released August 6th 2003 and stars Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Tess Coleman and her teenage daughter Anna couldn't be more different, and it is driving them both insane. After receiving cryptic fortunes at a Chinese restaurant, the two wake up the next day to discover that they have somehow switched bodies. Unable to switch back, they are forced to masquerade as one another until a solution can be found. In the process, they develop a new sense of respect and understanding for one another. I had grown up with this movie and always watch it a few times every year. There are 3 versions of this film, and even though this isn't the first one to be released it is obviously the best one. Each actor bodies each of the characters and I always get a good laugh out of it by stupid decisions some characters make and silly things that come out of their mouths. With a heart-felt ending, the whole movie and plot makes me giggle just thinking about it. As one of Lindsay Lohan's first few debut films, she did an absolutely amazing job, making this movie great, sad and funny at the same time. This movie has a couple music sequences, and although I am not too fond of musicals, I absolutely adore the songs featured in this film and I can never get enough of it. It's a perfect kid/teen movie to get a good laugh at and it being so nostalgic has given it it's place on my ranking</p>

          <br>
          <p>Coming up next is <b>Blended</b> Released on May 23rd 2014, was directed by Frank Coraci and stars Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Recently divorced mom Lauren and widowed dad Jim let their friends push them into a blind date, which goes disastrously wrong. Unsurprisingly, neither wants to see the other ever again. However, fate intervenes when both Jim and Lauren, unbeknown to each other, purchase one-half of the same vacation package at a South African resort; they and their children are forced to share the same suite and participate in a slew of family activities together. I had watched this movie for the first time 10 years ago when I was on vacation with my family, it had been playing in the background of our hotel room and as a little kid, this movie made me laugh very very hard. It has become family tradition to watch this film all together on every big family vacation. Many critics say this movie is just a waste of time and is a classic stupid Sandler film but I see it very differenly, it may have a dumb-witted plot but that doesn't make it necessarily bad, but instead just absolutely hilarious, it's little jokes here and there have never failed to make me laugh because of how clever they are. The main reason it is on my top 5 list is because of nostalgia as one of the earliest movies I remember seeing, but it still makes me laugh in today's day in age, so it will remain on my ranking.</p>

          </main>
          <br>
          <p>Last on my list is <b>Scary Movie</b> Also directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, was released on July 7th 2000 and stars Anna Faris, Regina Hall, and Shawn Wayans. A parody movie of the films "I know what you did last summer" and "Scream" is what this movie is, and overall just makes fun of horror movies and their cliches. I had first watched this film a few years ago, and just recently did I go on a binge where I watched it 8 times in a row for 8 days straight, one movie per night because it had made me laugh so hard I genuinely couldn't stop watching it. It was at that moment I realised it was easily one of my favorite comedy movies. The amazing performances done by each and every actor replicating the characters from the other films they were pretending to be is just on point. It makes you think of all the silly things horror movies have done and the Scary Movie series just shows how we need to open our eyes more and need to stop falling for the same tropes everytime we watch a new movie. The amazing use of irony just makes you realise how so many films are the same. The other movies of this franchise has parodies of movies such as "The Blair Witch Project", "Poltergeist", "The Ring" and more. But the Scary Movie franchise isn't the only type of films parodying horror movies, other projects like "Not another teen movie" parodies teen movies and "Disaster Movie" parodies action movies.</p>
